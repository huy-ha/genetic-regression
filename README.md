# Genetic Regression

## TODO

- Generate random expressions
  - Random search
- Implement statistics collector (for each evaluation, record a data point)
- Refactor plotter.py for general performance plots (Dot plot, convergence plot)
  - Specify in the run which data want to collect (no data, default to collecting fitness, option to collect all data for dot plot)
- All performance curves in one plot
- Results summary in table format
- Include all GA configs
